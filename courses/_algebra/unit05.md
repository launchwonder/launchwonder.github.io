### Targets

- Target 5A:  I can define and represent two quantitative variables on a scatter plot and describe how the variables are related (direction, shape, strength).
- Target 5B: I can distinguish between data sets that should be modeled by a linear function compared with an exponential function or other relationship.
- Target 5C: I can explain what the parameters of a model mean in the context of the situation (rate of change, initial value).
- Target 5D: I can differentiate between categorical and quantitative data.

### Vocabulary

##### Slope

How steep a line is. When a line moves *up* from left to right, it has **positive** slope. When a line moves *down* from left to right, it has **negative** slope. A line which is flat (horizontal) has **zero** slope. A line which is perfectly vertical has **undefined** slope. 

Slope, often denoted $m$, can be calculated by dividing the change in the $y$ direction by the change in the $x$ direction:

$$
m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
$$

##### Point-slope form 

$$
\color{blue}y - \color{green}{y_1} = \color{red}m(\color{blue}x - \color{green}{x_1})
$$

where: 
- $\color{red}m$ is the slope of the line
- $\color{green}{x_1}$ and $\color{green}{y_1}$ are the coordinates of a point on the line
- $\color{blue}x$ and $\color{blue}y$ are any other point on the line

You may also see it in the form:

$$
\color{blue}y = \color{red}m(\color{blue}x - \color{green}{x_1}) + \color{green}{y_1}
$$

Can you see how these two point-slope forms are equivalent?

Point-slope form is useful when you know two things: 
- The slope of a line
- The coordinates of a point on that line

Interestingly, point-slope form can be derived from the equation for slope:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} & = m \\ 
(x_2 - x_1) \cdot \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} & = m(x_2 - x_1) \\
y_2 - y_1 & = m(x_2 - x_1)
\end{align}
$$

##### Slope-intercept form

$$
y = \color{red}mx + \color{maroon}b
$$

where:
- $\color{red}m$ is the slope of the line
- $\color{maroon}b$ is the $y$-intercept, or the point where the line crosses the $y$ (vertical) axis

Slope-intercept form is useful when you know two things:
- The slope of a line
- The point where the line crosses the $y$ (vertical) axis

##### Standard form

$$
\color{teal}A\color{purple}x + \color{teal}B\color{purple}y = \color{teal}C
$$

where: 
- $\color{teal}A$, $\color{teal}B$, and $\color{teal}C$ are constants
- $\color{purple}x$ and $\color{purple}y$ are variables

Standard form can be used in situations where two variables are changing simultaneously. Or in other words, when you want to find out how proportions of two items add together to a known total (weight, cost, etc.).

For example, let's say Ali has \\$100 to spend on socks and hats. Socks are \\$10 and hats are \\$15. The standard form equation that models this situation would be $10s + 15h = 100$, where $s$ represents the number of socks Ali purchased and $h$ represents the number of hats Ali purchased. So if Ali buys 7 pairs of socks at a cost of \\$70, he'll be able to buy 2 hats at a cost of \\$30. He could also buy 10 pairs of socks and no hats, or one pair of socks and 6 hats, all at a *total* cost of \\$100.
