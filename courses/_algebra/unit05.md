### Targets

- **Target 5A:**  I can define and represent two quantitative variables on a scatter plot and describe how the variables are related (direction, shape, strength).
- **Target 5B:** I can distinguish between data sets that should be modeled by a linear function compared with an exponential function or other relationship.
- **Target 5C:** I can explain what the parameters of a model mean in the context of the situation (rate of change, initial value).
- **Target 5D:** I can differentiate between categorical and quantitative data.

### Vocabulary

##### Scatter plot

A graph of points which shows the relationship between two data sets.

![scatter plot](/images/scatter.png)
*A scatter plot showing the relationship between two sets of data.*

##### Outlier

A value that lies *outside* (hence the term "outlier") most of the other values in a given data set. Another way to think of an outlier is a value that is much bigger or much smaller than the rest of the values in a data set.

##### Line of best fit

The line which best represents the data of a scatter plot. In other words, the line of best fit is the best indicator of how the data sets which make up a scatter plot are related.

![line of best fit](/images/best-fit.png)
*A line of best fit for the above data set.*

##### Correlation

When two data sets appear to be associated (linked), we say that they have strong correlation or that they are highly correlated. Note that correlation is not the same thing as *causation* (what causes what). Correlation just indicates whether there's a link between two data sets.

##### Strength of correlation

How strong the [correlation](#correlation) between two data sets is. **Strong correlation** indicates that two data sets are strongly correlated and **weak correlation** indicates that two data sets are weakly correlated. Two data sets can also have **no correlation**.

##### Shape of correlation

The association between two data sets can be linear (in the shape of a line), or it can be some other shape.

![scatter plot and regression showing a linear relationship](/images/linear.png)
*In this graph, the association between the data set on the $x$ axis and data set on the $y$ axis is **linear**.*

![scatter plot and regression showing a non-linear relationship](/images/quad.png)
*In this graph, their association is **non-linear**.*

##### Direction of correlation

Correlation can be **positive**, like income and wealth (the more money you make the more likely you are to have money, and vice versa), and correlation can be **negative**, like absences and grades (the more absences, the lower a student's grade). Some pairs of data sets, such as grades and shoe sizes, shoe **no correlation**. 

##### Standard deviation

A number which shows how spread out a data set is.

##### Residual

The vertical distance between a point from a scatter plot and the scatter plot's line of best fit.

##### Slope

See definition in [Unit 4](/pointslopestandard/#slope).

##### $y$-intercept

See definition in [Unit 4](/pointslopestandard/#y-intercept).
