### Vocabulary

##### Slope-intercept form

$y = mx + b$

where:
- $m$ is the slope of the line
- $b$ is the $y$-intercept, or the point where the line crosses the $y$ (vertical) axis

Slope-intercept form is useful when you know two things:
- The slope of a line
- The point where the line crosses the $y$ (vertical) axis

##### Point-slope form 

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

where: 
- $m$ is the slope of the line
- $x_1$ and $y_1$ are the coordinates of a point on the line
- $x$ and $y$ are any other point on the line

Point-slope form is useful when you know two things: 
- The slope of a line
- The coordinates of a point on that line

Interestingly, point-slope form can be derived from the equation for slope:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} & = m \\ 
(x_2 - x_1) \cdot \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} & = m(x_2 - x_1) \\
y_2 - y_1 & = m(x_2 - x_1) && \text{since } \frac{(x_2 - x_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} = 1
\end{align}
$$

##### Standard form

$Ax + By = C$

where: 
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants
- $x$ and $y$ are variables

Standard form can be used in situations where two variables are changing simultaneously. Or in other words, when you want to find out how proportions of two items add together to a known total (weight, cost, etc.).

For example, let's say Ali has \\$100 to spend on socks and hats. Socks are \\$10 and hats are \\$15. The standard form equation that models this situation would be $10s + 15h = 100$, where $s$ represents the number of socks Ali purchased and $h$ represents the number of hats Ali purchased. So if Ali buys 7 pairs of socks at a cost of \\$70, he'll be able to buy 2 hats at a cost of \\$30. He could also buy 10 pairs of socks and no hats, or one pair of socks and 6 hats, all at a *total* cost of \\$100.
